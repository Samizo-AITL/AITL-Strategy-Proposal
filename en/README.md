## 🧭 Overview
This repository presents a **national-level architecture proposal** based on AITL (All-in-Theory Logic),  
together with a **validated integrated package** centered on Edusemi, extended with control (AITL-H) and intelligent integration for deployable PoC models.

---

## 🧠 What is AITL?
- **Logic Layer** — AI inference, anomaly detection, hypothesis generation  
- **Control Layer** — Explainable control with **PID / FSM** integration  
- **Physical Layer** — Sensors, actuators, real-world constraints

🎯 **Goal:** Real-time or quasi-real-time design, fault-time redesign, and physical constraint-aware SoC integration.
