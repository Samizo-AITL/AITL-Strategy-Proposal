## 0. Overview {#overview}

This proposal presents the **AITL Strategy (AI-Integrated Transition & Loop)**,  
which integrates **state feedback control** and **state transition control**,  
further enhanced by **LLMs (Large Language Models)** and **SystemDK (System Design Kit)**.  
This integration enables real-time to quasi-real-time **design modification**, **fault-time redesign**,  
and **constraint-aware implementation**.  

Traditionally, **control, analysis, and physical implementation** have been managed as **independent processes**.  
However, in advanced-node semiconductor design and next-generation autonomous systems,  
**operating them within a unified design framework has become indispensable for maintaining international competitiveness**.  
This proposal outlines a **practical framework** to achieve that goal.  

The technologies integrated in this proposal—  
- **control (state feedback + state transition)**  
- **design & analysis (LLMs)**  
- **physical implementation optimization (SystemDK)**  

are complementary elements that can directly share results and constraints.  
Together, they enable a level of **real-time, constraint-aware holistic optimization**  
that cannot be achieved through partial improvements alone.  

Moreover, the global semiconductor and control industries are undergoing rapid transformation.  
Without integrating these three technologies *now*, nations risk falling fatally behind in areas such as  
EUV-generation semiconductor design and industrial autonomous systems.  

In particular, SystemDK is not limited to AITL-specific applications—  
it is an **essential foundation for all advanced-node semiconductor design**.

## 1. Value of Feedback–Transition Integration {#feedback-transition}

Integrated control resolves the limitations of conventional methods  
(local optimization, poor tolerance to specification changes, and fragility under faults),  
and enables a **next-generation control framework** with stability, flexibility, and redundancy.  

| Item | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Stability** | Maintains continuous and stable operation even across different modes |
| **Flexibility** | Adapts flexibly to design-time and runtime requirement changes |
| **Redundancy** | Continues safe and efficient operation even when some functions fail |

## 2. Value of AITL with LLM {#aitl-llm-value}

By incorporating **LLMs (Large Language Models)** into **integrated control**,  
AITL creates **new value** that goes beyond conventional control and design paradigms.  

| LLM Role | New Value |
|---|---|
| **Situation Analysis** | Automates anomaly detection and root-cause estimation from logs and sensor data |
| **Quasi-Real-Time Design** | Adapts to specification changes within minutes, redesigning control algorithms and FSM structures |
| **Integrated Architecture Design** | Generates complete system architectures, including integrated control, directly from specifications |
| **Fault-Time Redesign** | Reconstructs operation modes by leveraging remaining functional modules during faults |
| **SystemDK Collaboration** | Integrates physical constraints and node characteristics from the early design stage to select the optimal implementation form |

## 3. Real-World PoC Examples {#poc-examples}

### 3.1 Integrated Robotic Control
- **Challenge:** In conventional systems, each joint or arm is controlled separately, and a failure in one actuator forces the entire system to shut down.  
- **AITL Solution:** With integrated control and LLM support, AITL can automatically generate a control system that allows remaining arms to continue operation even if one arm fails.  

### 3.2 Smart Factory Line Optimization
- **Challenge:** Traditionally, reconfiguring production lines after failures required manual intervention, taking several days before resuming operations.  
- **AITL Solution:** AITL enables integrated optimization of the entire production line, with LLMs analyzing equipment status and reconfiguring substitute lines within minutes.  

### 3.3 Autonomous Mobile Robot Fleet Control
- **Challenge:** Delays in coordinating paths among multiple robots caused overall efficiency to drop.  
- **AITL Solution:** AITL synchronizes overall fleet operations through integrated control, while LLMs optimize routing in real time based on traffic and situational analysis.  

---

### 3.4 Flagship PoC: Humanoid Robot Control {#flagship-poc}

This section presents the **Humanoid Robot PoC**, designed as the culmination of the AITL strategy.  
It integrates **control, semiconductors, and energy domains**, demonstrating a concrete model of **Physical AI**.

#### 🌐 Societal Significance
- **Disaster Relief:** Search and rescue in collapsed sites  
- **Elderly Care:** Mobility and assistance support  
- **Industry:** Task replacement in factories, mountains, and hazardous zones  

The humanoid robot based on AITL is not merely a prototype, but a **symbolic PoC connecting policy, industry, and education**.

## 4. Need for SystemDK in AITL Implementation {#systemdk}

When implementing AITL into real systems, it is essential to reflect **physical constraints (thermal, stress, power, EMI, etc.)** at the earliest design stage.  

**SystemDK (System Design Kit)** provides the foundational design framework that makes this possible.  

The application scope of SystemDK extends beyond AITL, encompassing **semiconductor chip design as a whole**.  

In particular, for **future advanced-node semiconductor chips**, design methodologies based on SystemDK—which integrate physical constraints at the earliest stages—will be **indispensable**.  

- Enables early countermeasures against thermal and signal interference in high-density environments.  
- Integrates FEM analysis directly into the design phase, achieving co-optimization across circuits, packages, and substrates.  
- Ultimately improves design efficiency, product reliability, and mass-production yield.

## 4.1 Technical Challenges and Risks {#risks}

| Category | Challenge | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| **AI Reliability** | Ensuring accuracy and consistency of LLM responses | Misjudgments or hallucinations leading to control errors |
| **Security** | Cybersecurity resilience of integrated control systems | Production shutdowns, reduced safety |
| **Physical Model Integration** | Integrating FEM-based physical models with real-time control | Design delays, performance degradation |
| **Standardization & IP** | Aligning intellectual property and licensing with standardization | Loss of international competitiveness |

---

## 5. Policy Recommendations {#policy}

### 5.1 Expected Benefits (Model Case)

**Assumption:** Introduction of AITL into a domestic production line, based on PoC evaluation data.

| Item | Conventional | With AITL | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fault Response Time | 8h | 30min | 94% reduction in downtime |
| Line Reconfiguration | 2 days | 2h | 8× productivity improvement |
| Design Change Cost | 100 | 60 | 40% cost reduction |

### 5.2 Policy Roadmap

```mermaid
timeline
    title AITL Policy Implementation Roadmap
    2025-2027 : Launch foundational R&D programs
    2027-2029 : Establish international standardization WG
    2029-2032 : Launch industrial implementation consortium
```

- **2027–2029:** Establishment of an international standardization working group  
- **2029–2032:** Launch of an industrial implementation consortium  

### 5.3 Academic Systematization & Human Resource Development

AITL and SystemDK represent an interdisciplinary domain spanning physics, control, and AI—beyond the reach of field engineers alone.  

Therefore, it is essential to establish a systematic discipline—tentatively called *“AITL Studies”*—with dedicated Master's to Doctoral-level curricula.  

Graduates trained in this field will flow into industry, bridging the gap between R&D and implementation, thereby ensuring sustainable international competitiveness.  

Furthermore, **international joint research networks** and **industry–academia collaboration hubs** should be established to create a feedback loop between academic insights and industrial requirements.  

This will enable continuous education, research, and implementation grounded in AITL Studies, ensuring a sustainable talent pipeline and strengthened international competitiveness.
