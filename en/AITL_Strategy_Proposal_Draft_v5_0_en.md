# üá∫üá∏ **AITL Strategy Proposal v5.0**  

---

## üöÄ 0. Executive Summary

**AITL (AI-Integrated Transition & Loop)** integrates:  
- **PID control (Stability)**  
- **FSM control (Mode Transition)**  
- **LLM design (Redesign)**  

and embeds **physical constraints** (thermal, stress, power, EMI) from the earliest design stage through **SystemDK**.  

This proposal is based on **PoC evidence from core papers published in 2025**, providing a bridge across **industry, education, and policy**.
