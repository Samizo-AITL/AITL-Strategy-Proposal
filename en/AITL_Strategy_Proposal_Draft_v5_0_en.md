# 🚀 AITL Strategy Proposal v5.7 (Policy Edition, English Only)

## 0. Executive Summary

AITL (AI-Integrated Transition & Loop) integrates three layers:
- **PID Control (Stability)**
- **FSM Control (State Transition)**
- **LLM Design (Redesign & Integration)**

SystemDK embeds physical constraints (thermal, stress, power, EMI) from the earliest design stage, enabling a new design paradigm: **Runtime Physics-Aware DTCO**.

This proposal, grounded in measured PoC evidence from multiple core papers published in 2025, presents concrete pathways to industry, education, and policy.

Key achievements include:
- **Humanoid control:** posture recovery within 200ms, 30% gait stability improvement, 15% energy efficiency improvement.
- **CFET control:** compensation for sub-2nm interconnect delay and thermal coupling.
- **Space applications:** long-term autonomous operation on 22nm FDSOI FPGA.

These validated hardware-based PoCs are rare internationally. While the US, EU, and China emphasize reinforcement learning, ethics, or large-scale AI, Japan uniquely integrates **control + AI + physical constraints** through AITL.

This uniqueness grants Japan a **strategic advantage for technological leadership and economic security**.

## 1. International Comparison

### 1.1 Similar Approaches and Limitations

| Region | Representative Projects | Technical Approach | Limitations & Challenges |
|---|---|---|---|
| USA | DARPA "Assured Autonomy", NASA AI Control | Reinforcement learning–based adaptive control, formal methods | Weak integration of physical constraints (thermal, power, reliability); issues with long-term stability in space and defense |
| EU | Horizon Europe "AI4CyberPhysical", "HumanE AI" | Cyber-physical integrated AI, ethics-focused | Emphasis on social/ethical aspects; lacks hardware-level PoCs |
| China | Next-Generation AI National Strategy | AI chip development, civil–military fusion, autonomous control | Massive technical output but weak global acceptance in standardization |
| Japan (AITL) | AITL v5.0/v5.1 PoCs | Three-layer PID+FSM+LLM with SystemDK embedding physical constraints | Only framework worldwide integrating control, AI, and physical constraints; leadership in international standardization is key |

### 1.2 Differentiation Points
1. **Uniqueness of Three-Layer Architecture** → Only AITL combines PID×FSM×LLM with SystemDK.  
2. **Validation through Hardware PoCs** → Demonstrated in robotics, semiconductors, and space.  
3. **Education & Standardization Strategy** → Japan can uniquely push both international standards and HRD.  

### 1.3 Strategic Implications
- AITL should be emphasized as a **next-generation control foundation integrating physical constraints**, distinct from DARPA or Horizon Europe.  
- A four-quadrant map (USA = AI control, EU = ethics, China = scale, Japan = AITL) is recommended for international presentations.

## 2. Core Framework: SystemDK with AITL

SystemDK extends PDK by integrating thermal, stress, EMI, and RC delay constraints into design.  
AITL integrates PID, FSM, and LLM for real-time stability, supervised transitions, and redesign.  

Together, **SystemDK with AITL** enables Runtime Physics-Aware DTCO: continuous loops between design and operation, embedding physical constraints from the start.

Japan, unlike the US/EU/China, has already demonstrated this integration via hardware PoCs, positioning it uniquely in the global context.

## 4. KPIs & Policy Implications

### 4.1 KPI Table

| KPI | Target | Result | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Posture Recovery | ≤150ms | ≤200ms | Humanoid |
| Gait Stability | +20% | +30% | Humanoid |
| Energy Efficiency | +15% | +15% | Humanoid |
| Self-Powering | 20% | 12% | Humanoid |
| FeFET Retention | ≥10y@85℃ | Validated | FeFET CMOS |
| FeFET Endurance | ≥1e5 cycles | Validated | FeFET CMOS |
| Power Efficiency | >80% | Validated | CMOS018 Inductor |
| Ultrasonic Sensitivity | High | Validated | ScAlN |
| Droplet Precision | pL-scale | Validated | Bio-Inkjet |
| Graduate Training | ≥100/year | Planned | AITL Studies |
| Intl. WG Participation | ≥10 | Planned | Policy |

### 4.2 Analysis & Implications
- Achieved: Semiconductor, MEMS, inkjet KPIs met.  
- Partial: Humanoid recovery lagging but stability/efficiency exceeded.  
- Unmet: Self-powering at 12% (target 20%) → R&D focus.  
- Planned: HRD and standardization → require policy support.  

Policy should prioritize **energy harvesting R&D**, and treat HRD/standardization as **policy-driven KPIs**.
